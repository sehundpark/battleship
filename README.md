## 📍 Overview

The Battleship Game project is a fully interactive browser-based game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming with key classes like Ship, GameBoard, and BattleshipGame, which manage game state, ship placement, and the turn-based logic.
